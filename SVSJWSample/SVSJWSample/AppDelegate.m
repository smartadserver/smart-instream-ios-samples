    // It is recommanded that you request authorization for location detection if your app does not already request it
    // before integration of the Instream SDK.
    // If the user grants you the right to detect his location, the SDK will find it automatically and pass it to the ad server when making ad calls,
    // this will allow a better targeting and increase your RTB revenues.
    // Don't forget to setup the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key in your Info.plist.

    // OPTIONAL
    // By default the SDK will use the IDFA of the device to identify the user.
    // If IDFA is not available due to user's privacy settings, SDK will generate a transientID, renewed every 24h.
    // This transientID will not be used for tracking but only for capping purposes.

    // your custom identifier.
